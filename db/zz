26088964 is a commentary on  25678561 raising a lack of evidence for SIGMARI to be pathogenic, and that previous reports of patients with SIGMARI variants were also shown to harbour C9orf72 expansions.  26088963 - in reply, authors state that there is in vitro and in vivo evidence, and expression evidence, and that a case reported did not have the C9orf72 expansion

However, genetic deficiency of IL-21 associates with inflammatory bowel diseases and blockade of IL-21 in the early phases exacerbates the disease progression in some models of rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, thus suggesting a dual role of IL-21 in the control of immune-mediated diseases."

25213858 - Using these markers and the FDA-approved RIPK2 inhibitor Gefitinib, we show that pharmacologic RIPK2 inhibition drastically improves disease in a spontaneous model of Crohn Disease-like ileitis. Furthermore, using novel RIPK2-specific inhibitors, we show that cellular recruitment is inhibited in an in vivo peritonitis model. Altogether, the data presented in this work provides a strong rationale for further development and optimization of RIPK2-targeted pharmaceuticals and diagnostics

20352044 - "We conclude that in a population drawn from North of England pathogenic CHMP2B mutations are found in approximately 1% of cases of ALS and 10% of those with lower motor neuron predominant ALS. We provide a body of evidence indicating the likely pathogenicity of the reported gene alterations. However, absolute confirmation of pathogenicity requires further evidence, including documentation of familial transmission in ALS pedigrees which might be most fruitfully explored in cases with a LMN predominant phenotype."

They therefore investigate the R113C point mutation in mice "We demonstrate here for the first time that the expression of mutated vimentin induces a protein-stress response that contributes to disease pathology in mice, and hypothesise that vimentin mutations cause cataracts in humans."

These mutations were absent in 200 normal control chromosomes as well as 129 other congenital cataract patients. Nevertheless, these mutations were also detected in a heterozygous state in the DNA from the patients’ apparently healthy sibling and mother, respectively. One sequence variant, c.440C4T, p.A147V, was a polymorphism, which was found three times in the cohort and was not present in all affected individuals in a familial case."

26795956 - a rare nonsynonymous variant, p.A40S, was detected in the MRAP2 gene in a 10-year old boy with overall obesity in combination with intellectual disability in a screen of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) patients. The clinically diagnosed PWS could not be confirmed molecularly with MS-MLPA and CNV analysis of the 6q14.1–q16.3 region also showed no deletions in this patient. No further family data were available to determine whether the variant segregates with obesity in this family. It was shown to be (probably) damaging by in silico analysis and found in only one European (non-Finnish) individual in the ExAC database (since this database cannot release phenotype information about the screened individuals, no conclusions regarding causality of this variant can be drawn).

27474872 - screened the entire coding region of MRAP2 for mutations in 184 children and adolescents with extreme obesity and 184 healthy lean controls. Nonsynonymous variants were then genotyped in a larger, independent study group of 300 children and adolescents with extreme obesity and 436 controls. Detected variants were also analyzed in vitro to determine their effects on MC4R signaling: p.Gln174Arg was the only variant to show an effect by reducing MC4R signalling function. Heterozygous variants were described in 4 individuals. For only two (p.Ala137Thr and p.Arg125His) were relatives also available, and the mothers of the probands were also heterozygous and had not/did not display an obesity phenotype. "In sum, our family-based genetic data do not support the relevance of the two presumably benign MRAP2 mutations for the development of obesity, they might even have no influence on body weight regulation...additional functional analyses could well reveal a functional effect of all nonsynonymous MRAP2 mutations." "We detected association of nonsynonymous MRAP2 mutations to obesity (eight carriers of nonsynonymous mutations in 1,334 individuals with obesity vs. zero carriers of nonsynonymous mutations in 1,108 controls, nominal Fisher’ exact two-sided P<0.005) in a crude meta-analysis on all currently available data."

26059841 - the two siblings who had atypical clinical courses, such as a lack of PVNH and a spontaneous improvement of CIPO. A 4-bp deletion in exon 40 was reported, and functional studies revealed that the variant induced in-frame skipping of the mutated exon, which led to the translation of a mutant FLNA missing an internal region of 41 amino acids. "Functional analyses of the mutant protein suggested that its binding affinity to integrin, as well as its capacity to induce focal adhesions, were comparable to those of the wild-type protein. These results suggested that exon skipping of FLNA partially restored its protein function, which could contribute to amelioration of the siblings' clinical courses."

26990861 - c.665C>T homozygous variant was identified in 3 affected siblings with Early-Onset Generalized Dystonia-Parkinsonism (and was heterozygous in the unaffected patients and an unaffected sibling). It was confirmed by Sanger sequencing and had a frequency of 0.01% in the Exome Aggregation Consortium database, predicted to be deleterious by 2 of 6 in silico tools. They showed it was within a founder haplotype shared by all previoulsy reported cases.
